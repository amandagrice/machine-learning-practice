# IMDB Classification

This is a neural network to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library on top of TensorFlow. It uses the [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home) dataset already included with Keras.

It has an accuracy of 0.8829600214958191 or ~88.3%.

I used Francois Chollet's book "Deep Learning with Python" as a tutorial.
