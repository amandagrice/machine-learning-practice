# MNIST Digits

This is a neural network to identify handwritten digits created using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library on top of TensorFlow. It was trained using the [MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

It has an accuracy of 0.9782999753952026 or ~97.8%. 

I used Francois Chollet's book "Deep Learning with Python" as a tutorial.
